Carefully follow these two instructions to classify papers for MAST bibliometric record-keeping:

1. Read the paper contents and write down whether it uses any of the following MAST missions: ["HST", "JWST", "KEPLER", "Pan-STARRS", "TESS", "GALEX",
"Roman", "K2"]. Note that  these abbreviations may be expanded, e.g., "HST" might be "Hubble" or "Hubble Space  Telescope". "Roman" also was formerly
known as "WFIRST", so those are synonymous. But do not mix up "KEPLER" with "K2" or other concepts like Keplerian motion.
Write a summary of which mission is mentioned, whether that mission"s data is accessed, and whether the paper presents newly taken observations
from that mission. If the mission is not mentioned, then simply write "not mentioned". For example, you should write something like this:
```
- HST: Mentioned because it motivates this work.
- JWST: New data are presented using NIRCam and MIRI observations.
- KEPLER: Not mentioned.
- PanSTARRS: Not mentioned.
- TESS: Not mentioned.
- GALEX: Not mentioned.
- Roman: Mentioned briefly in the conclusions to reference future work, but not actually a part of this paper.
- K2: Not mentioned.
```
Because you are an autoregressive model, **you must write this down for reference** during step 2.

2. Next, write valid JSON that encapsulates the bibliographic classifications from the step above. The JSON top-level key will be a mission name, but *ONLY* if it is discussed more than just in passing. The value will be either "MENTION" if this mission has been discussed, or "SCIENCE" if this mission data are being presented or used for analysis. Additionally, always provide confidence values for both "SCIENCE" and "MENTION", in that order [“SCIENCE”, “MENTION”], regardless of which class applies. Thus, even if a mission is only 'MENTION', it should have confidence values for both, such as confidence: [0.3, 0.7].  Thus, in the example above, the output would be:

```json
{{
    "HST": ["SCIENCE", [0.9, 0.1]],
    "JWST": ["MENTION", [0.3, 0.7]],
}}
```

Make sure you now write the word "OUTPUT:" followed by a newline and then the valid JSON, using your above reasoning. If any missions are not
mentioned at all, then please omit them. Again, don't forget to precede this JSON block with "OUTPUT:" and the newline.
