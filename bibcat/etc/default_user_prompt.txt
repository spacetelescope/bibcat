Carefully follow these two instructions to classify papers for MAST bibliometric record-keeping:

1. Read the paper contents and write down whether it uses any of the following MAST missions:
["HST", "JWST", "Roman", "HLA", "HSC", "TESS", "KEPLER", "K2", "GALEX", "PanSTARRS", "FUSE",
"IUE", "HUT", "UIT", "WUPPE", "BEFS", "TUES", "IMAPS", "EUVE"]. Note that  these abbreviations may be
expanded, e.g., "HST" might be "Hubble" or "Hubble Space  Telescope". "Roman" also was formerly
known as "WFIRST", so those are synonymous. But do not mix up "KEPLER" with "K2" or other concepts like
Keplerian motion.  Also do not mix up cases where these phrases appear in target names, e.g. "K2-18 b".
Write a summary of which mission is mentioned, whether that mission"s data is accessed, and whether the paper presents newly taken observations
from that mission. If the mission is not mentioned, then simply write "not mentioned". For example, you should write something like this:
```
- HST: Mentioned because it motivates this work.
- JWST: New data are presented using NIRCam and MIRI observations.
- KEPLER: Not mentioned.
- PanSTARRS: Not mentioned.
- TESS: Not mentioned.
- GALEX: Not mentioned.
- Roman: Mentioned briefly in the conclusions to reference future work, but not actually a part of this paper.
- K2: Not mentioned.
```
Read the paper first and think carefully first about your answer before writing anything down. Because you are an autoregressive model, **you must write this down for reference** during step 2.

Here are the MAST missions that have been found in the paper with a simple text match: {missions}.  Use this information to help you focus and make decisions.

2. Next, write valid JSON that encapsulates the bibliographic classifications from the step above. If a "response_format" is provided, then follow its schema.  Otherwise follow the following schema:

 - notes: all your notes and thoughts you have written down during your process
 - missions: a list of your identified missions, with each item in the list a dictionary with the following structure:
   - mission: the name of the mission
   - papertype: the type of paper you think it is
   - confidence: a list of float values of your confidence
   - reason: a short sentence summarizing your reasoning for classifying this mission + papertype
   - quotes: a list of exact quotes from the paper that support your reason

*ONLY* include a mission in the list if it is discussed more than just in passing. The papertype value will be either "MENTION" if this mission has been discussed, or "SCIENCE" if this mission data are
being presented or used for analysis. Additionally, always provide confidence values for both "SCIENCE"
and "MENTION", in that order [“SCIENCE”, “MENTION”], regardless of which class applies. Thus, even if a
mission is only 'MENTION', it should have confidence values for both, such as confidence: [0.3, 0.7].
Thus, in the example above, the output would be:

```json
{{
    "notes": "I have read the paper and found no mention of Kepler, but I did see JWST and HST.  Then I reread to better understand what kind of paper this is.",
    "missions": [{{
        "mission": "HST",
        "papertype": "SCIENCE",
        "confidence": [0.9, 0.1],
        "reason": "The primary data in this paper comes from Hubble observations.",
        "quotes": ["We present new data using HST observed with the STIS instrument."],
    }}, {{
        "mission": "JWST",
        "papertype": "MENTION",
        "confidence": [0.3, 0.7],
        "reason": "JWST is mentioned briefly in the conclusion"
        "quotes": ["Our work presented here will help inform new JWST follow-up observations."]
    }}]
}}
```

Make sure you now write the word "OUTPUT:" followed by a newline and then the valid JSON, using your above reasoning. If any missions are not
mentioned at all, then please omit them. Again, don't forget to precede this JSON block with "OUTPUT:" and the newline.
