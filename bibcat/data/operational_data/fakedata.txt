Modern telescopes allow us to observe the night sky at higher sensitivity than ever. This has allowed us to push our observations toward fainter and fainter stars. In this paper, we present a statistical analysis of new Hubble ultraviolet spectra and their stark dependence on stellar mass, and show that the latest data illustrate strong trends in the so far unexplored parameter space. We ultimately characterize stellar radiation for both faint and bright stars. The target stars are discussed in Section 1. The new HST observations are fully presented in Section 2. The spectra are plotted, and the UV models fitted, in Section 3. The statistical trends in the data are presented in Section 4 and MCMC fits in Appendix C. Finally, results are summarized and discussed in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.
